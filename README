Installation

Make sure that the correct Ruby version is installed (see .ruby-version or use e.g. `rbenv install`).
`gem install bundler`
`bundle install`

Make sure that node and npm are installed,
`npm install`

You should now be able to perform a `rake` for generating the work files or `rake dist` for generating minified distributeable files.

There is a `rake deploy` task that deploys to a web server. Create a `deploy.yml` with the correct connection data. See `deploy.yml.example`.

The app itself is hosted by thin, but this is a working configuration
for nginx. It should be hosted ssl-only (except for maybe a redirect from http to https).

http://verlichting_cluster is configured elsewhere.

server {
  listen 443;
  server_name ~^lights.*\.host\.com$;

  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /usr/local/nginx/conf/lights.host.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/lights.host.com.key;

  allow all;

  location / {
    root /var/www/verlichting/build;
  }

  location /my_zwave {
    proxy_pass http://verlichting_cluster;
    proxy_pass_header Server;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

    # This is necessary for secure cookies.
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
