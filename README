The app itself is hosted by thin, but this is a working configuration
for nginx. It should be hosted ssl-only (except for maybe a redirect from http to https).

http://verlichting_cluster is configured elsewhere.

server {
  listen 443;
  server_name ~^lights.*\.host\.com$;

  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /usr/local/nginx/conf/lights.host.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/lights.host.com.key;

  allow all;

  location / {
    root /var/www/verlichting/build;
  }

  location /my_zwave {
    proxy_pass http://verlichting_cluster;
    proxy_pass_header Server;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

    # This is necessary for secure cookies.
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
